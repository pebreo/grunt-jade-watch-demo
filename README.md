OVERVIEW

This is demo on how to generate HTML files with Jade using Grunt - specifically, `grunt-contrib-watch` and  `grunt-contrib-jade`.

Grunt is like unix `make` but for Javascript - it makes automation easy. Grunt uses a `Gruntfile.js` to store the tasks that it can do. 

NPM is a Javascript package manager. It uses `package.json` to keep track of the libraries that your project requires. You can automatically create a `package.json` file by typing `npm init` in your project root, and as you add more libraries using `npm install mypackage`, the `package.json` file will be updated automatically.

INSTALLATION
---
```
a) Make sure you have npm installed
b) Make sure you have a Gruntfile.js and package.json 
1) npm init
2) npm install grunt --save-dev
3) grunt watch
```
